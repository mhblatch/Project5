      <td width="436"><p align ="center">My name is Mei-An Blatchford and I am a student at the University of Maryland: College Park. I am studying Computer Science and Art Studio. </p>
        <p align ="center">   As an artist, I am interested in combining art and technology. As a lover of coding, I like creating computer graphics and user interface design. My favorite medium is digital but I also enjoy creating ceramics, paint and charcoal.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">I have always wanted to do computer graphics and graphic design since I was 12 years old but I also told myself that art is not a career for me, so I stopped pursuing it. Growing up as an Asian American, I had to meet of expectations of being smart. My projected career path was to be an engineer, so I pursued that. My freshman year of college, I was in a major that made me unhappy. So, I switched to Art Studio my second semester and felt happier and more excited about continuing my education on a higher level. I added a Computer Science major to satsify my love of coding. I was worried about not being able to have a job if I pursued an art degree. I have found that I can be a computer scientist and an artist.&nbsp;</p>
        <p dir="ltr" align="center"><strong>I can create art through code.</strong></p>
